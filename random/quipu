# Description

The Quipu is a syle of tracking information by the use of ropes and knots. 

Basic versions of this consist of monocolor ropes with single knot for a point of information. This information was only decipherable by the one who created it or explained to by the original creator. So if the scholors were killed, the quipu was never again able to be read.

once the scholors created a standard for Quipu writing, there was a more complex version to keep more dense and recoverable information.

# Discovery

The use of a quipu originated from herders that would keep track of their cattle by tying a knot for each animal. Over time, people started using it for other record keeping, such as taxes, census data, etc. As the empire expanded, so too did the needs for records. implimentation of different colored strands and more complex knots were implimented to expand on the amount of data able to be recorded. Eventually it became a written language for the empire. (Emporer) issued a decree that a standard was created for quipu to facilitate empire wide record keeping. A college was also created for tax collectors and other government officials.

# Access / Availability

The quipu was only really available to scholors due to its complexity and the cost of creating the colored rope. Most of the empire's subjects used their own versions of the quipu but only a primitive version that would be specific to each individual.

# Complexity

At its hight of complexity, a standard size quipu can hold as much information as a standard christian bible. The most skilled quipu scribes can make their knots more of a compact weave pattern. Each line of rope can consist of eight different colors coorisponding to different characters and are used to create complex sentences with a single knot.
