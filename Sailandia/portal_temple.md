# GM Notes

portal temple is made to be the home/hub of the PCs. They will be slowly upgrading their home with blacksmith table, alchemical table, etc. There are slots for each specialization. There seems to be remnants of some of them for them to explore initially. 

* The players will find a runes table with a weapon for each martial character. 
    * They will choose from a small subset of runes. 

# Setting

### Building architecture

The building sits higher than all the other manmade structures around it. It is assumed that it was created on a hill before the collapse. 

Modeled after the Hoechest building in Frankfurt Germany. 
    * impossibly tall for architecture of the time
    * Engineering feats at the time were based on the height and efficiency
    * each floor is dedicated to a different type of trade or mastery
    *
